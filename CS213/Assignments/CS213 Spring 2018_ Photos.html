<hr>
<p>For this assignment you will build a photo application that allows storage 
and management of photos in one or more albums.

</p><p>You will work <b>in pairs</b> on this assignment. Read the
<a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity/programming-assignments">
DCS Academic Integrity Policy for Programmming Assignments</a> - you are responsible
for this. In particular, note that <b>"All Violations of the Academic
Integrity Policy will be reported by the instructor to the appropriate Dean".</b>
</p><hr>

<p>In this assignment, you will design and implement a single-user
photo application, with all user interaction implemented in Java FX,
and all UIs--except for standard Java FX dialogs such as Alert and
TextInputDialog--designed in FXML.  

</p><p>You may use multiple stages to show complex secondary windows, and 
switch multiple scenes within a stage.

</p><p>

</p><p>You will continue working with your partner.

<hr>

<a name="overview"></a><h2>Features</h2>

<p>Your application must implement the following features:

</p><p><b>Date of photo</b>

</p><p>Since we won't examine the contents of a photo file to get the date 
the photo was taken, we will instead use the last modification date of the photo 
file (as provided
via the Java API to the filesystem) as a proxy. (The user interface will still
refer to this as the date the photo was taken.)

</p><p>You may want to
use a <code>java.util.Calendar</code> instance for the date and time the photo
was taken. <b>Note:</b>
When you set a date and time in a <code>Calendar</code> instance,
<font color="red">also make sure you set milliseconds to zero</font>, as in:
</p><pre>     
     cal.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND,0);
</pre>
Otherwise your equality checks won't work correctly.

<p>Alternatively, you may
use the classes in <tt>java.time</tt>
to manipulate dates and times.

</p><p><b>Tags</b>

</p><p>Photos can be tagged with pretty much any attribute you think is useful to search
on, or group by. Examples are location where photo was taken, 
and names of people in a photo, so you can search for
photos by location and/or names.

</p><p>From the implementation point of view,
it may be useful to think of a tag as a combination of <b>tag name</b> and 
<b>tag value</b>, e.g. 
("location","New Brunswick"), or ("person","susan"). A photo may have
multiple tags (name+value pairs), but no two tags for the same
photo will have the same name and value combination. 

</p><p>Additional details:
</p><ul>
<li>You can set up some tag types beforehand for the user to pick from 
(e.g. location)
</li><li>Depending on the tag type, a user can either have a single value for it, 
or multiple values (e.g. for any photo, location can only have one value, 
but if there's a person tag, that can have multiple values, one per person 
that appears in the photo)
</li><li>A user can define their own tag type and add it to the list (so from that 
point on, that tag type will show up in the preset list of types the user 
can choose from)
</li></ul>

<p><b>Location of Photos - Stock photos and User photos</b>

</p><p>There are two sets of photos, <b>stock photos</b> that come pre-loaded with the
application, and <b>user photos</b> that are loaded/imported by a user when
they run the application. 

</p><ul>
<li>Stock photos are photos that you will keep in the application's
workspace.  <font color="red">You must have no fewer than 5 stock photos, 
and no more than 10</font>. 

<p>Create a special username called
"stock" (no password, or password="stock") and store the stock photos
under this user, in an album named "stock".

</p><p>Leave the photos in the application's
workspace so the graders can test your application starting 
with your stock photos, then load other photos from their computer,
see "User photos" below. 

</p><p>Try to work with low/medium resolution pictures for the
stock photos because they will be on Bitbucket and downloaded by the
graders, and you don't want to bloat your project size.
Make sure
that your application will work correctly even if there are no stock
photos to start with. (Think of the scenario
where a user might delete all the stock photos that comes with
the application before loading any of their own - your application
should be able to present a sensible interface if/when this happens.)

</p></li><li>User photos are photos that your application can allow a user to
load from their computer, so they can be housed anywhere on the user's
machine. The actual photos must NOT be in your application's
workspace. Instead, your application should only store the location of
the photo on the user's machine.  User photo information must NOT be
in the released project in Bitbucket since each installation of your
application on a machine will have its own set of users.
</li></ul>

<p><b>Login</b>

</p><ul>
<li>When the application starts,
a user logs in with username. Password implementation is optional. It makes for
a "real" scenario, but is irrelevant to the essence of the project. (There is
no extra credit if you choose to implement passwords.)
</li></ul>

<b>Admin Subsystem</b>

<ul>
<li>There must be a special username <b>admin</b> that will put
the application in an administration sub-system. The <b>admin</b> user can then do
any of the following:
  <ul>
    <li>List users</li>
    <li>Create a new user</li>
    <li>Delete an existing user</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<p>Note: If you elect to implement passwords for users,
make "admin" the password for the <b>admin</b> user, so it's easier to grade.
Otherwise we will need to ask you, or look in some README file, etc, which
just turns out to be a needless hassle.
</p></ul>

<p><b>Non-admin User Subsystem</b>

</p><ul>
<li>Once the user logs in successfully, all albums and photo information for this user 
from a previous session (if any) are loaded from disk. 

<p>Initially, all the albums 
belonging to the user should be displayed. For each album, its name, the number of
photos in it, and the range of dates (earliest and
latest date) on which photos were taken must be displayed.
Use your discretion on how to show this additional information. 
</p></li><p></p>
<li>The user can then do the following:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Create albums</li>
  <li>Delete albums</li>
  <li>Rename albums</li>
  <li>Open an album. Opening an album displays all photos, with their <em>thumbnail</em>
   images and
  captions, inside that album. Once an album is open the user can do the following:</li>
  <!-- Maybe split into two lists -->
  <ul>
    <li>Add a photo</li>
    <li>Remove a photo</li>
    <li>Caption/recaption a photo</li>
    <li>Display a photo in a separate display area. The photo display should also show 
    its caption, its date-time of capture (see <b>Date of photo</b> below), 
    and all its tags (see <b>Tags</b> below).
</li>
    <li>Add a tag to a photo</li>
    <li>Delete a tag from a photo</li>
    <li>Copy a photo from one album to another (multiple albums may have
        copies of the same photo)</li>
    <li>Move a photo from one album (source) to another (the photo will be removed from
        the source album)</li>
    <li>Go through photos in an album in sequence forward or backward, one at a time, 
with user interaction (manual slideshow)</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Search for photos (Photos that match the search criteria should be
  displayed in a similar way to how photos in an album are displayed).
    Under this, you should provide the following specific features:
    <ol>
      <li>Search for photos by a date range. </li>
      <li>Search for photos by tag type-value pairs. The following types of
          tag-based searches should be implemented:
          <ul>
          <li>A single tag-value pair, e.g person=sesh 
          </li><li>Conjunctive combination of two tag-value pairs, e.g. person=sesh AND
              location=prague
          </li><li>Disjunctive combination of two tag-value pairs, e.g. person=sesh OR
               location=prague
          </li><li>For conjunctions and disjunctions, if a tag can have multiple values
              for a photo, it can appear on both arms of the conjunction/disjunction,
              e.g. person=andre OR person=maya, person=andre AND person=maya
          </li></ul>
          You are NOT required to do conjunctions/disjunctions on more than two
          tag-values pairs.<br>
          In other words, you are not required to do stuff like t1=v1 and t2=v3 and t3=v3
    </li></ol>
    </li><li>There should be functionality to create an album containing the search results.

<p>As mentioned earlier (under Copy a photo from one album to another), 
a photo can be in multiple albums. Creating an album out of search results means
copying these photos to a new album, <em>without deleting them from the current 
album(s) to which they belong</em>.
</p></li></ul>
<p>Note: A single user may not have duplicate album names, but an
album name may be (coincidentally) duplicated across users. 

</p></ul>

<p><b>Logout</b>

</p><ul>

<li>The user (whether admin or non-admin)
logs out at the end of the session. All updates made by the user
are saved to disk.

</li><li>After a user logs out, the application is still running, allowing
another user to log in.
</li></ul>

<p><b>Quit Application</b>
</p><ul>
<li>The user (admin or non-admin) quits the application 
<b>safely</b> at any 
time by closing the application window (bypassing the logout step). 
<b>Safely</b> means that all updates that were
made in the application in the user's session
are saved on disk.
</li><li>Unlike logout, the application stops running. The next user that wants to
use the application will need to restart it.
</li></ul>

<p><b>Errors</b>
</p><ul>
<li>In the application all errors and exceptions should be handled gracefully within
the GUI setup. The text console should NOT be used at all: not to report any error,
not to read input, not to print output.
</li></ul>



<hr>

<h2><a name="model"></a>Model</h2>

<p>The model should include all data objects, plus code to store and retrieve
photos for a user. The collection of classes that comprise the model should
be in its own package, separate from the view and controller.

</p><p><font color="red">You are required to use the 
<code>java.io.Serializable</code> interface, and the
<code>java.io.ObjectOutputStream</code>/<code>java.io.ObjectInputStream</code>
classes to store and retrieve data.</font>

</p><p>Note that your application will need to 
store content for multiple users, so it would be a good idea to separate
different user's contents from each other. 

</p><p>You need to think about what objects you want to have in your design,
with what attributes and operations. It is important to plan this out and 
come up with a good object-oriented design that clearly separates roles and
functions between objects, and can be cleanly extended to add more features
for future versions of the application.

</p><hr>

<p></p><h2><a name="storyboard"></a>GUI Storyboard</h2>

Your first task is to design the UI in the form of 
a <b>storyboard</b>.

<p>The storyboard is a sequence of
screen diagrams that shows all paths of flow through the interface.
Here's a <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/213/classes/spring_2019_venugopal/photos/storyboard.pdf">sample storyboard</a> for a 
calculator application that gives
you an idea of what you should do. This is an older version built
with Swing, so ignore the labels of the Swing widgets.
Also, this is not a complete storyboard in that it does not show all
possible screens that are in the UI it describes, nor does it
necessarily show all possible transitions between screens. What it
does show is how to draw screens, how to label screen components, how
to draw transitions between screens, and how to label transitions.

</p><p>It is important to have one or more overview diagrams
that show all screens and all transitions between them, without any
details of the components within the screens themselves. This is an
overview that can give the complete picture in
one shot. The rest of the storyboard will then draw each screen
in detail.

</p><p>Each screen must be drawn using some drawing package. Or, you can
even include screenshots off SceneBuilder rendering of FXML UI layouts.
<font color="red">But Screenshots that you take off a Java program WILL NOT be
accepted.</font> In other words, there should be <b>no Java code</b> written at this
stage at all. 

</p><p>Each screen will represent one window of your GUI and will contain
all the widgets that go into that screen - text fields, buttons, etc. 
Be as precise as you can about the selection and 
layout of the components in a screen. <font color="red">While it is not necessary that
you label each Java FX component you will use (as in the sample storyboard),
it will help you if you do because there is a smaller amount
of design issues to worry
about when you start coding the application logic.</font>

</p><p>Each screen will show transitions to other screens and the
events that trigger these transitions. When all is said and done, you
will have effectively drawn up a storyboard of your entire GUI that shows
all screens and all inter-screen transitions.

</p><p><b>Note</b>: The title for each screen should be descriptive of
what the screen does. The sample storyboard
says "Calculator" for all titles, but 
for your storyboard, name every screen with an
appropriate title. This can serve as the title to be displayed
in the titlebar when you implement these screens in code.

</p><p><b>Grade Credit</b>: Credit for the storyboard will be
based on how well it anticipates (and determines) the implementation
of the GUI. This portion of the grade for your storyboard will be
given <b>after</b> you finish the implementation, 
and we can look at how useful your storyboard has been
for your implementation. This means your storyboard is not set in stone,
as in you can make some changes to the UI when you build it because you
thought of some new/different elements. But the final result can't 
be too different from the original storyboard, which if it does, will
imply that you didn't think through the UI well enough to start with.

</p><hr>

<h2><a name="worksplit"></a>Work Split Document</h2>

<p>When you have finished designing the storyboard, you need to decide
how to split the work of implementing all the windows. Implementing
a window will also include
all non-visual aspects associated with it, all event handling,
the connections to the other parts of the GUI, and the connections
to the control and model. The work split must be as equal as you
can make it. 

</p><p>Type up the work split documentation (plain text or PDF, no
other format will be accepted).
Make a table with two columns:
in one column list the name of the window to be implemented,
and in the second, the team member who will implement it.

</p><hr>

<h2><a name="gui"></a>Complete Implementation</h2>

<p>Code your application using the standard installation of Java, using for
your GUI Java FX 8 and FXML <b>only</b> (No Swing). 
<font color="red">No external vendor libraries.</font>
We will test with standard Java so if you use any external packages, your
program will not run, and you will not get credit.

</p><p>Document every class you implement with Javadoc tags, and be sure to
include authorship. 

</p><p>Represent the object-oriented design of the entire application
using a UML class diagram. This should include both the classes you have built,
as well as the Java FX classes. 
For the latter, just the class name will suffice--shade the class box so it's easy to
visually separate the Java FX classes from yours.
For each class built by your application, show
all public fields and methods in the UML representation.

</p><p>Keep in mind that you
will need classes that are not visually represented, but perform
data-management functions, as well as broker between the visual
classes and the backend. These should be in your UML as well.

</p><p>Finally, hand-drawn UML diagrams are NOT acceptable. You should use
drawing software to do the UML. (Google Slides is an easy option,
but if you find a UML drawing app, feel free..) The end product should
be a PDF file.

</p><hr>

<h2><a name="bitbucket"></a>Bitbucket Contents</h2>

<p>Your project should be named PhotosXX, where XX is your 2-digit group
number.

</p><h3>By Sunday, Mar 17, 11 PM</h3>

(The <b>docs</b> and <b>data</b> directories mentioned below should be created directly
under the project, NOT under <b>src</b> or under any of the packages).

<ul>
<li><b>GUI Storyboard</b>: The final form of your storyboard should be a PDF file
called <b>storyboard.pdf</b>, which should be placed 
in the <b>docs</b> directory. <font color="red">This should be committed by ONE partner ONLY.</font>
</li><li><b>Work Split Document</b>: The final form of this document should be a plain

<h2><a name="grading"></a>Grading</h2>

Your project will be graded on the following, for 225 points:

<p>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse;cellspacing:0px;border: 1px solid ; font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none;margin-left:20px;">

</p><p><b>EXTRA CREDIT</b>:
</p><ul>
<li>(Up to <b>15 points</b>) for exceptional features. 

<p>We don't have any specific
expectation of what these features might be (if we did, we could have included
them in the required set.) So it's entirely up to you. The only
thing we can say is for a feature to deserve extra credit it has to deliver
<b>useful additional functionality</b> - simply dressing up the UI
(better colors, widgets, layout, fonts, etc.) will not count.


</p></li></ul>

<p><b>Penalties</b> (up to 25 points) will be assessed on the
following:
</p><ul>
<li>If you (individually) did not commit one of storyboard or
worksplit document by Mar 17, 11 PM.
</li><li>Not using FXML adequately/appropriately to design the UI
</li><li>Inadequate Javadoc tags/Javadoc HTML documentation not generated
</li><li>Project structure does not properly separate model, view, control classes
with appropriate package configuration
</li><li>Needing extra configuration on our part to test your project
because you did not follow specifications
</li><li>Usability is poor such as roundabout ways to get at data, and/or
confusing interface
</li><li>Lacks scalability i.e. doesn't display large amounts of data 
(e.g. many tens of photos or more) in a
easily navigable way</li>
<li>10 pts: Every time you ask us and we test another commit version in your
repository that is earlier than the last commit before the deadline.
</li><li>10 pts: For every 2 hours of lateness, in case there is nothing
in the repository for us to test as of the deadline of Apr 17, 11 PM.<br>
<font color="red">NOTE: This 2 hour block will be applied STRICTLY starting any time
after 11 PM (even if it is one second), in increments of 2 hours. NO EXCEPTIONS.</font>
