<h2>CS 213 Spring 2019: Android Project</h2>
<h2>Chess OR Photos OR RYO (Roll Your Own)</h2>
<h3>Posted Fri, Apr 12<br>
Due Wed, May 8, 11 PM in BitBucket<br>
</h3>
<h3>Worth 200 points (20% of course grade)</h3>
</center>
<hr>
You will continue working in pairs. If you choose to roll your own
project, you must get approval from
your grader - see the RYO section at the bottom of this page.

<p><font color="red">You MUST use Git/Bitbucket to manage your
repository. Your app MUST run correcty on the Nexus 4 (4.7 inch,
768x1280, xhdpi) device emulator that comes with Android Studio.
Make sure your app runs on Android API Level 28 (Android 9.0 - Pie)
(This API level SDK comes pre-installed with the Android Studio download).
We will test only for this level. 
</font>

</p><p>You may serialize the data used in your app,
but are not required to do so - you can use alternative formats for storage on the
device. 

</p><hr>
<h2>Photos</h2>

<p>
You are not required to carry over all the functionality from the Java FX implementation. 
Instead, you will implement a smaller set, as described below. You may reuse any of the
code from your Java FX project.
</p>

<p>
Since the app will run on a personal smart phone, there is only a single user, who is the 
owner of the phone. So there is no logging in, and no admin functionality. Also, 
explicit captions are
not required for photos (the filename will stand for the caption). 
Dates are not required either.
</p>
<p>
    
</p>

<h4>Your app should implement the following features:</h4>

<ul>
<p></p><li><span class="pts">30 pts</span> Home screen. When the app comes up, it should load album and photo
data from the previous session, if any, and list all albums with names in
plain text.
Off this "home" screen, you should be able to do the following, in one or more navigational
steps.
<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">40 pts</span>  Open, create, delete, and rename albums as listed in the 
Java FX project description. When opening an album, display all its photos, with 
their thumbnail images.
<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">40 pts</span>  Once an album is open, you should be able to 
add, remove, or display a photo.
The photo display screen should include an option for a slideshow,
allowing you to go backward or forward in the album one photo at a time with
manual controls.
<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">20 pts</span>  When a photo is displayed,
you should be able to add a tag to a photo.
Only person and location are valid tag types; there are
no typeless tags. You should also be able to delete a tag from a photo.
Note: When displaying a photo, tags (if any) should be visible.
<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">20 pts</span>  You should be able to move a photo from one album to another
<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">50 pts</span> You should be able to
search for photos by tag (person and/or location), and matches should allow
completion. For instance, if a location "New" is typed, matches should
include photos taken in New York, New Mexico, New Zealand, etc.
Note: You are not required to implement functionality to add new tag types,
or save the matching photos in an album.
<p></p>
</li></ul>


<hr>

<h2>Chess</h2>
<p>
Port the terminal-based Chess program to Android: a chess app that lets two 
people play chess with each other on the phone. You may reuse any code from your 
chess assignment. You have to implement all the moves for all the
pieces, determination of check, checkmate, and illegal moves (<em>including any
that puts the mover's King in check</em>), but you are not required to implement
stalemate.
</p>
<p>
Your app implement the following:
</p>

<h3>Playing chess (120 pts)</h3>

<li><span class="pts">30 pts</span> Two humans can use your app to play a game of Chess.

<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">20 pts</span> Your app must draw the board with icons and correctly shaded squares.

<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">20 pts</span> Players must move their pieces using touch input - either dragging a piece or touching first the piece's original square and then its destination.
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">10 pts</span> Provide an 'undo' function that will undo the last move (but no farther).
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">10 pts</span> Provide an 'AI' button that will choose a move for the current player. Choosing randomly from the set of legal moves is sufficient.
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">20 pts</span> Provide functional 'draw' and 'resign' buttons.
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">10 pts</span> When the game is over, report the outcome.

<h3>Recording games (50 pts)</h3>

</li><li><span class="pts">20 pts</span> Record all games as they're being played.

<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">10 pts</span> At the conclusion of a game, offer to store it and prompt the user for a game title.
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">20 pts</span> List all recorded games, sorted by both date and by title (user can select which view to choose).

<h3>Game playback (30 pts)</h3>

</li><li>A function that allows the user to play a selected recorded game. The selected game should be
playable one move at a time, per player.

<hr>

<h2>RYO</h2>

<p>You need to get approval from your grader. For this, you will need to provide
the following to them:

</p><ul>
<li>A short description of the app
</li><li>A detailed description of all features
</li><li>A storyboard of all activities that will be displayed to the user.
</li></ul>

<p>Depending on this, you may be asked to expand/shrink/modify the features (so there is
sufficient breadth and depth, but not so much that you can't finish the project on time),
before final approval. Also keep in mind if there is server set up required, you (NOT
your grader) will be responsible for doing it yourself.

</p><p><font size="+2">If you plan to go this route, start planning early so you can get approval 
with enough time left to build!!</font>
