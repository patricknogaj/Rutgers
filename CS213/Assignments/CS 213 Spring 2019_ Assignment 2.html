<p>For this assignment you will explore how to apply the object-oriented
design ideas you learned in class to design and implement the chess game.

</p><p>You will work <b>in pairs</b> on this assignment. Read the
<a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity/programming-assignments">
DCS Academic Integrity Policy for Programmming Assignments</a> - you are responsible
for this. In particular, note that <b>"All Violations of the Academic
Integrity Policy will be reported by the instructor to the appropriate Dean".</b>
</p>

<p><font color="red">IMPORTANT</font>: 
Note that you will be maintaining your code in Bitbucket,
which is a source code repository. Learning how to manage your source code 
INCREMENTALLY and in COLLABORATION with your project partner is an important
skill, and Bitbucket (like Github) is a code repository that allows you to
do this effectively. Read the last section on Submission for more details.
</p><hr>

You will implement the game
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a> for two
players.  Your program, when launched, should draw the board
<font color="red">in text, on the terminal</font> and prompt
whomever's turn it is (white or black) for a move. Once the move is
executed, the move should be played and the new board drawn, and the
other player queried.

<h3><a name="output"></a>Output</h3>

<p>
The board should be drawn on the screen with ascii art <font color="red">EXACTLY</font>
as shown in this <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/213/classes/spring_2019_venugopal/chess/display.txt">example</a>. Note there is a blank line above
and below any prompt/message your program will print, and the board itself.
Deviations from this exact format will incur a penalty.

</p><p><font color="red">You will NOT use a graphical user interface</font>, 
that is not the point of this
assignment. If you do, your submission will NOT be graded.

</p><p><font color="red">You MUST have white make the first move.</font> 
Having black make the first move
is not appropriate, and will incur a penalty.

</p><p>If you are not clear about any of this, or have ANY questions or issues,
CHECK with your grader.

</p><p><b>Note:</b>
</p><ul>
<li>Every piece must know what moves are allowed on it. If a player attempts an
illegal move on a piece, your program should not execute the move. Instead, 
it should print "Illegal move, try again", followed by the usual prompt 
(for white's move or black's move).
<p></p></li><li>When a move is made, and it puts the opponent's King
under check, your program should print "Check" before prompting
for the opponent's move.
<p></p></li><li>If a checkmate or stalemate is detected, your program should print "Checkmate" or
"Stalemate". <br>
<p><b>Stalemate implementation is optional - 10 points extra credit if you do it
correctly - see Extra Credit section below.</b>
</p><p></p></li><li>The last thing before termination should be a display of "Black wins",
"White wins" or "draw".
</li></ul>

<p></p><h3><a name="input"></a>Input</h3>

<p>
Your program needs to accept input of the form "FileRank FileRank", where the first file 
(column) and rank (row) are the coordinates of the piece to be moved, and the second file and 
rank are the coordinates of where it should end up. (See the board example shown above.)
</p>

<p>
The figure immediately below should make it clear which rank and file combinations belong to 
which squares. The white pieces always intially occupy ranks 1 and 2. The black pieces always 
initially occupy ranks 7 and 8. The queen always starts on the d file.
</p>
<img src="./CS 213 Spring 2019_ Assignment 2_files/SCD_algebraic_notation.svg">

<p>
As an example, advancing the white king's pawn two spaces would be input as "e2 e4".
</p>

<p>
A castling move is indicated by specifying where the king begins and ends.
So, white castling king's side would be "e1 g1".
</p>

<p>
A pawn promotion is indicated by putting the piece to be promoted to after the move. So, 
promoting a pawn to a knight might be "g7 g8 N". If no promotion piece is indicated, 
it is assumed to be a queen.
</p>

</p>

<h3><a name="end"></a>Ending the game</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
If checkmate or stalemate occurs, the game shall end immediately with the result reported.
</p>
<p>
</p></li><li>A player may resign by entering "resign".
<p></p>
<ul>

</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li><p>
A player may offer a draw by appending "draw?" to the end of an otherwise regular move. The 
draw may be accepted by the other player submitting "draw" as the entirety of his or her next 
move. There will be no automatic draws (due to unchangeing positions over long periods of time, etc).
</p>
<ul>

<p><font color="red">You are NOT required to implement termination by threefold repetition, or 
the fifty-move rule</font>. (You are welcome to include them in your code to make it complete;
however, there is no extra credit for either.)

<h3><a name="code"></a>Submission/Code Maintenance in Bitbucket</h3>

<p>Use the Git/Bucket page in the Sakai 213 site (right under Assignments)
to know how create a repository in Bitbucket (
<font color="red">and NO, you may NOT use Github!!!</font>)
and manage it using Git. There
is a comprehensive walk through of all the features you need to know
to manage your code collaboratively. <font color="red">In particular, all Git examples
are shown on the command line, which is the recommended way to use Git
from your computer.</font> This is because it is clear as to what's going on,
so it is easy to recover from mistakes, if any. (Using an app/plugin with
a GUI generally hides a lot of things under the hood, and if things go awry
you may not have enough transparent info to work with and fix things.)

</p><p>Create a new repository and give your grader read access. 

</p><p>Create an Eclipse project, name it <tt>ChessXX</tt>, where XX is the two digit group
number. Use packages as necessary. There should be at least one package,
called <tt>chess</tt>, with the main class called <tt>Chess</tt> in it. 
This is the class that we will run when testing your program.

</p><p>Create a <tt>docs</tt> directory under the project. You 
will put your complete generated Javadocs HTML documentation in this directory.

</p><p><font color="red"><b>Make your Eclipse project folder the root of your 
Bitbucket repository</b></font>. This way, when we get your project from
Bitbucket, we get the entire Eclipse project space, with source and binary
files, and all data that is in the project in the right places.

</p><p><font color="red">EACH partner in the team will make a first Bitbucket commit in the
project by Friday, Mar 8. </font>
The BitBucket commit
does not have to be any Java code, you may commit any text file, with as little
as a single letter in it. 

</p><p>Thereafter, you will make commits incrementally, as and when you add reasonable 
functionality to your implementation. Aside from that first commit that should
come from each partner, we are not asking for a specific number
of commits from either partner, as long as you have found a way to work
together. 

</p><p>In any case, do NOT use Bitbucket like a Sakai assignment drop, not
making any commits after the first, and then making the second one the final
commit just before the deadline. If you do this, you are wasting a great
chance to learn an important skill you will be required to use in real projects, 
and will have one less thing to show to prospective employers.

<h3><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<b>Q:</b> Do we have to implement a rule where a player is not allowed to make an
otherwise valid move if it will immediately put their king in check?<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes. This qualifies as an illegal move.

<p><b>Q:</b> Do we need to worry about bad input, like a player entering "draw" 
without being asked by the other player, or just entering things that don't make 
sense?<br>
<b>A:</b> No

</p><p><b>Q:</b> The assignment says we have to print "Illegal move, try again" if the player 
attempts an illegal move, but can we print more specific messages to identify 
the kind of illegal move?<br>
<b>A:</b> No, you must stick with the described format.
(You will have the option to do all kinds of cool stuff when you build an Android app 
for chess.)

</p><p><b>Q:</b> Will differences in output such as 
"White has no valid moves" instead of "Stalemate", or 
"White is in checkmate" instead "Black wins" be OK?<br>
<b>A:</b> No, it's not ok. Your program should print "Checkmate" 
(followed by "White wins" or "Black wins"), or "Stalemate" (followed by "draw").

</p><p><b>Q:</b> We saw rules elsewhere on castling/stalemate/what-have-you that 
go beyond the description on the linked Wikipedia page. Should we implement those?<br>
<b>A:</b> No, we are going with the Wikipedia page only. 
We are not all practiced Chess players.

</p><p><b>Q:</b> Should we print the board out again if the user tries to 
input an illegal move?<br>
<b>A:</b> No

</p><p><b>Q:</b> If an opponent's piece is captured, should 
we indicate a captured piece?<br>
<b>A:</b> No

</p><p><b>Q:</b> For the resign examples, should we add "Black wins" or "White wins" at the 
end?<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes

</p><p><b>Q:</b> Can we use Github instead of Bitbucket?<br>
<b>A:</b> No
