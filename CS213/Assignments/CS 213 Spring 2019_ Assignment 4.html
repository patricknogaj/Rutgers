<h2>Assignment 4</h2>
<h2>Online Discussion Forums UML</h2>
<h3>Posted Fri, Mar 29. Due Wed, Apr 10 by 11 PM IN SAKAI (NOT Bitbucket).</h3>
<h3>Worth 35 points (3.5% of course grade.)</h3>

<hr>

<p>In this assignment you and your partner
will develop an object-oriented design and draw the UML, for the 
discussion forums hosted on a website, as described below.
</p><hr>

<p></p><h3>Online Discussion Forums</h3>

<ul>

<p>There is a website that hosts discussion forums. A person first needs to be a 
registered user on the website before they can participate in one or more forums.
A user does not necessarily have to be a member of any forum.
</p><ul>
  <li>The website hosts several forums.
<p>  </p></li><li>Each forum has one or more members.
<p></p></li><li>Members of a forum can:
    <ol><li>post messages to the forum</li>
      <li>read messages posted by other members to the forum, filtered and/or sorted
by message author, thread, or date</li>
<li>leave a forum
      </li></ol></li>
<p>  </p><li>Each message is part of a discussion thread. It can be the initiating message for a 
   new thread, or a response to a previous message in a thread
<p></p></li><li>Users on the website can:
    <ol><li>create new forums</li>
      <li>join an existing forum as member</li>
      </ol></li>
<p>  </p><li>Every forum has a single owner, who is initially the creator of the forum. The 
creator of a forum automatically becomes its first member.
<p></p></li><li>Each forum has one moderator, who is initially the creator of the forum. 
Only a forum member can be its moderator.</li> 
<p>  </p><li>Owners can:
<ol>
<li>invite users to join their forum by sending them an email invitation</li>
<li>invite a member to be the moderator - if the invitation is accepted, the 
new moderator replaces the current moderator
</li><li>invite a member to take over ownership - if the invitation is accepted, the ownership
is transferred to that member
</li><li>delete the forum
</li></ol>
<p></p></li><li>Moderators can:
<ol>
<li>deny or pass through messages posted to the forum by members
</li><li>resign as moderator by sending an email to the owner, at which point the owner
becomes the moderator
</li></ol>
</li></ul>

</ul>

<h3>UML</h3>

<ul>

<p>Choose the most appropriate representation for each entity in the
model.  (Entity here refers to class or interface.) Use interfaces and
abstract classes as needed. In each class, list the key attributes and
methods you determine are needed to fulfill the specification. Not all
details are explicitly mentioned in the specification above, but must
be filled in by inference. Such details include choice of attributes
and their data types, choice of operations with parameters and return
values, and choice of access levels (public/protected/package/private)
for attributes and operations.

</p><p>Pay special attention to the relationships between entities.
Remember, super-sub classes, and interface implementations are the strongest
connections between entities, followed by associations, followed by
dependencies. Make sure you are as specific as you can be with the
multiplicities in associations, and whether an association is a plain old
link or an aggregation or a composition, whether it is bidirectional,
unidirectional or reflexive. Note: Every association is by definition
bidirectional unless you explicitly show unidirectionality. Make sure
you show multiplicities for all associations.

</p></ul>

<h3>Supplement to the UML</h3>

<ul>

<p>For each association, list the data structure(s) (full type
definition in Java) that will be used to implement the data that
arises out of the association, and name the class(es) to which it/they
will belong. (Refer to Slide 7--Relationship data--of the lecture notes
in mar12-uml-3.pdf for an example.) You are not required to write the class outline. 
Just draw a table with two columns, one for each data structure type
definition, and the other for the class in which it will be
defined. If the class is not either of the end points of the
association, but a new class altogether, then make this fact explicit in the table.

</p></ul>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<ul>

<p>Your UML and supplement
will be graded on completeness, appropriate choices in class/interface/abstract class
for entities, in relationships between entities, and in 
the data structures used to implement association-specific data. 
"Appropriateness" speaks 
to the best applicable/most precise
design choices based on all the object-oriented design issues we have
covered in class, 
flexibility (how easy it is to use your design for a range of functionality),
extensibility (how easily your design can be extended to add more capabilities), 
maintainability (how easy it is to fix problems that may be arise in implementation).
Not all of these may apply with
equal importance (every model is different) but you want to use this as a checklist 
against your design to spot, and correct, obvious flaws.
</p></ul>

<h3>Submission Instructions </h3>

<ul>

<p>Submit a single PDF file, called <tt>forums_uml.pdf</tt>, to Sakai.
(Whatever software you use to draw the diagrams/write text, you MUST convert to
PDF.) The PDF document
should have the UML as well as the supplementary
table of data structures. If you have trouble fitting the UML in
one page, draw the UML with only the class names and relationships between them on 
one page, and then on other pages, draw the details for each
  entity. Hand-drawn/hand-written submissions will NOT be accepted.
</p><p><b>
Submit ONE PDF for your team, but write the names of both members in the document.</b>

</p></ul>
