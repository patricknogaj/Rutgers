<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Design and implement an application with a graphical user interface to manage
a library of songs. <b>A song is uniquely identified by a combination of 
name and artist (case INsensitive).</b>
Your application should have a SINGLE WINDOW with three functions:
</p><ol>
<li><b>Song list display</b>, with the ability to select ONE song from the list. 

<p>The list will
display the name and artist ONLY for each song, in <b>alphabetical order of names</b>
(and <b>within duplicate names, by alphabetical order of artists</b>).
Unless the
list is empty, one song is always pre-selected, and its details shown - see the
following item.
</p><p></p></li><li><b>Song detail</b>, with name, artist, album, and year, of the song that is
selected in the song list interface
<p></p></li><li><b>Song Add/Delete/Edit</b>, for adding a new song, deleting a selected song,
and editing a selected song:
<ul>
<p></p><li><b>Add</b>: When a new song is added, the song name and artist should be entered
at the very least. Year and album are optional. If the name and artist are the
same as an existing song, the add should not be allowed - a message should be
shown in a pop-up dialog, or by some other means within the main application
window.

<p>The newly added song should automatically be placed in the
correct position in the alphabetical order in the list. Also, it should be
automatically selected, replacing the previously selected song, and its details should be shown.
</p><p></p></li><li><b>Edit</b>: ANY of the fields can be changed. Again, if name and artist
conflict with those of an existing song, the edit should NOT be allowed - a message
should be shown in a pop-up dialog, or by some other means within the main
application window.
<p></p></li><li><b>Delete</b>: Only the selected song in the list can be deleted.
After deletion, the next song
in the list should be selected, and the details displayed. If there is no next
song, the previous song should be selected, and if there is no previous song
either, then the list is empty and the detail info is all blanks.
</li></ul>
<p>For any of the add/delete/edit actions, 
the user should be able to cancel (or back out of) the action if they change their mind
after starting the action.
</p></li></ol>

<p>Note: If you use the song detail display area for add/delete/edit as well
(instead of two separate areas), then make sure the interface is not
confusing to the user, particularly if the add or edit is disallowed or aborted
by the user.

</p><p>When your program is started, it should show the current list of songs in the
library, in the song list display, with the first 
song selected by default. (The first time the program
is run, there should be nothing in the display, since there won't be any
songs in the library.)

</p><p>The song library data should persist across different sessions of your program. 
You can save the song list in a file in whatever TEXT (human readable)
format you like, and then read it into your program when it starts up. 
(This means you may not serialize the data, even if you know how to do it,
because serialized data is not human readable.)

</p><p>Your application is NOT required to play a song when it is selected. In other words,
there is no requirement to have audio playing functionality, and there will not be any
extra credit if you choose to implement this functionality.

</p><p>The application window need NOT be resizable. 
When the window is closed, the application should be terminated.

</p><p>Most of the aspects of design (layouts and widgets) 
and implementation (event handling) you need for this assignment
have been covered in class. If there is any aspect you want to add that has not
been covered in class, you are expected to discover these for yourself.
Here is a good starting <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javase-clienttechnologies.htm">documentation</a> to explore the FX world.

</p><p><font color="red">NOTE</font>:
</p><ul>
<li>You <font color="red">MUST use Java FX 8</font> for all UI-related code. 
(No Swing stuff.) 
</li><li>In your app, there should be <font color="red">only ONE window</font>
for all user interaction.
</li><li>The layout for this single application window should be in 
<font color="red">fxml ONLY</font>. In other words, none of the UI 
elements should be created using Java code.
</li><li>You may use pop-ups ONLY to show an error message, or to ask for 
confirm/cancel
of an action, but NOT for anything else - all inputs and edits
must be done in the main window.
</li><li>You may NOT use Table View for any aspect of your UI.
</li></ul>
<p></p><p></p><hr>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<ul>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>GUI Component</th><th>Points</th></tr>
<tr><td>Song list+selection</td><td class="pts">7</td></tr><tr>
</tr><tr><td>Details display</td><td class="pts">6</td></tr><tr>
</tr><tr><td>Add/Delete/Edit</td><td class="pts">20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Persistence</td><td class="pts">7</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</ul>

<p>For the first three items, the grade will depend on correctness and
completeness of functionality, as well as <b>effective/appropriate</b> use of 
JavaFX widgets. 
For the last part (persistence), grading is on correctness, and on ensuring this
is transparent to the user, i.e. the user should not have to be concerned with
where and how the song list is stored between sessions.

</p><p><b>Effective/appropriate</b>
means the UI should be clear, the user should know exactly what to expect when
events are triggered, the user should know exactly what to do to achieve their
objective. <font color="red">If you need to explain to someone
how to use the interface, then it's not a good enough interface. </font>

</p><p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Your UI should not use widgets that are an overkill for the task
at hand because if a complex widget is used for a simple task, it will confuse
the user. So, for instance, do NOT use a table view to show song details because
the requirements do not ask you to dynamically rearrange the display on
user request. In fact, do NOT use a table view at all, for any aspect
of your UI - if you do so, you will lose credit - see 
the <b>Point Deductions</b> section at the end of this document.

</p><p>Finally, your UI is not required to be aesthetically pleasing (no points for 
this because it's highly subjective), but you are most welcome to dazzle us
with your creativity (just for the heck of it!) as long as it does not get in
the way of clean functionality.

</p><p>You may use any of the classes in the standard Java SDK, but 
<b>no external third-party libraries EXCEPT if you want to use JSON to
store and retrieve song data.</b> If you elect to use JSON,
you will need to use a JSON library (jar)- inform your grader so that
they know to get the library when they test your app.

</p><hr>

<h3>Submission Instructions </h3>

<p>You may implement the application in as many files as you want,
but you MUST call your main class <tt>SongLib</tt> (this is the class with the
<tt>main</tt> method.) 

</p><p>Also, you must organize your classes into packages. There is no requirement
for how many packages you need to use, as long as there is at least one.
In other words, none of your classes must be directly under <tt>src</tt> (which
basically amounts to a default package) - this is bad design because it
severely limits the way in which you can control access to members of a class.

</p><p>Make sure to write your names at the top of each of the Java source
files in your project.

</p><p>Export your 
project to a zip file called <tt>songlib.zip</tt> (see 
how to do this in the Eclipse page, under "Zipping up a Project").
Make sure you have done this 
correctly by importing it back as a project into Eclipse (see "Importing a Zipped
Project into Eclipse" in the Eclipse page). Since you are working pairs, a good
test would be for one of you to zip the project, and for the other to import
the zipped project into their Eclipse installation.

</p><p>Submit your <tt>songlib.zip</tt> file to Sakai. Just ONE submission per team,
please! (You get up to 3 submissions - any submission will overwrite
the previous, so only latest submission will be graded.)

<h3>Point Deductions</h3>

Be aware that implementing design and functionality as specified,
and submitting ("releasing") your implementation as required, are both important
aspects of software development in the real world. The point deductions
listed here are intended to alert you to this. 

<ul>
<li>5 points, if the application window does not show up at all, but we can
fix the code to make it show. So make sure it actually shows when you run the application. 
</li><li>5 points, if the application window cannot be closed, or it closes but does not
terminate the application
</li><li>5 points, if you do not implement your main method in a class named <tt>SongLib</tt>
(see Submission Instructions)
</li><li>5 points, if you have any code in the default package (directly under <tt>src</tt>)
(see Submission Instructions)
</li><li>Up to 5 points, if you do not write your name at the top of all the files you
submit.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>10 points, if the displayed list of songs is not in alphabetical order as 
specified in the <b>Song list display</b> item.
</li><li>10 points, if you did not use FXML for the UI design of the main window. (This
does not apply to the pop-up dialogs to report input errors, or for confirming/canceling
any of the add/edit/delete actions.)
</li><li>10 points, if any window other than the application frame pops up
at any time (except for error dialogs for incorrect add and edit, if you choose
to use dialogs for these, or dialogs for confirm/cancel of any action).
</li><li>10 points, if you use a table view anywhere in your UI.
</li><li>10 points, if you do not submit your implementation in a project zip file
(see Submission Instructions) that can imported into Eclipse as a complete
project
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Points will be deducted for each test case that cannot be tried because either
your data file or your UI does not allow for testing it. The exact number of 
points will depend the point value of the test case(s).
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><b>No credit</b>, if you used any external libraries--you are only allowed to use
the standard Java SDK, and optionally JSON (with permission from grader).
</li><li><b>No credit</b>, if your program does not compile, or cannot be run. This is a
course in software development, there is NO excuse to submit something that does
not compile or does not run.
</li></ul>
